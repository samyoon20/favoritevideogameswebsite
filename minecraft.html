        <h2 class="section-title">About Minecraft</h2>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>Minecraft is a block-based sandbox game that allows players to build, explore, and create in an expansive, procedurally generated 3D world.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section forest">
        <h2 class="section-title">Forest Biome</h2>
        <img src="img/forest.jpg" alt="Forest Biome">
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>The forest biome was one of the first biomes created for Minecraft. The forest biome holds some of the most useful resources for the players but the lack of visibility makes it difficult to fight and run against mobs. It is also difficult to build in tight spaces in wooded areas.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section desert">
        <h2 class="section-title">Desert Biome</h2>
        <img src="img/desert.jpg" alt="Desert Biome">
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>The desert biome was another one of the first biomes created for Minecraft. The desert biome is notorious for having the most difficulty with mobs due to the fact that there's nothing but barren land and sand. There is much less resources in the desert biome but the abundance of sand and interesting creatures makes up for it.</p>

        <div class="section-content">
            <p>An essential part of the Minecraft world is the ocean. The ocean is home to many resources and food for the players. The ocean makes up the majority of minecraft land and continues to surprise players with creatures like squid, pufferfish, and dolphins while also holding shipwrecks and hidden treasures.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Mountain Biome</h2>
        <img src="img/mountain.jpg" alt="Mountain Biome">
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>The mountain biome has extremely high elevations and come with waterfalls and lavafalls. The steep cliffs and quick changes in elevation make it a dangerous area for players. However, for the players with fast reaction times, it will not pose a large problem.</p>

    <div class="section jungle">
        <h2 class="section-title">Jungle Biome</h2>

        <div class="section-content">
            <p>The jungle biome is regarded as one of the most dangerous biomes in minecraft. A newer edition to minecraft biomes, the jungle includes many dangerous creatures but is home to one of the most beautiful nature-filled biomes in Minecraft. The jungle biome carries the most resources out of any biome.</p>

        <div class="section-content">
            <p>A mesmerizing field of snow, the snowy-tundra biome is a combination of the forest and mountain biome underneath piles of snow. The snow adds to the overall aesthetic of the game and is home to many specific winter loving animals.</p>

            <p>The Nether is the other world, the other dimension to Minecraft. The Nether holds many dark and dangerous mobs but also holds the key to finishing and beating the game. The Nether is a necessary evil to conquer to finish the game. Filled with lava and dangerous mobs, it's definitely a place to be careful.</p>
